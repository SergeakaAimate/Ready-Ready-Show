# Rules of the Game "Ready-Ready-Show!"

## Objective
Be the first to uncover your opponent’s original six-letter word by calling "Show!", or win if your opponent surrenders by saying "Fold".

## Requirements
Two players. Pen and paper for each player. Poker chips or tokens for the pot (optional).

## Setup
Each player secretly writes down a six-letter noun (must be a valid dictionary word). The pot starts at 0 units. The maximum pot size is 5 units. Determine the starting player by lot (e.g., coin toss).

## Gameplay
Players take turns. On your turn, you must choose one of three actions:  
1. **"Ready"** — Modify your current word by one of the following methods: Replace one letter with another, Add one new letter (anywhere in the word), Remove one existing letter. All word variants must be recorded in a column (original word at the top, each modification below the previous). After modifying, declare "Ready". The pot increases by 1 unit, and turn passes to your opponent.  
2. **"Fold"** — Surrender (allowed only after at least one turn has been completed by any player). Your opponent immediately wins the entire pot, and the game ends. Upon folding, you are not required to reveal your original word or modification history.  
3. **"Show!"** — Issue a challenge (allowed only on your turn and after at least 3 total turns have been taken). Your opponent must silently reveal their current word only (not the full history). You have 60 seconds to guess the original six-letter word (one attempt only). If correct — You win the entire pot! If incorrect — Your opponent wins the pot and is not required to reveal the original word or modification history. If time expires — Your opponent wins the pot and is not required to reveal the original word or modification history.

## Pot Limit Rule
Once the pot reaches 5 units, the player whose turn it is must call "Show!".

## Example Game: "Ready-Ready-Show!" in Action
Players: Alex and Bailey. Starting Pot: 0 units.  
**Setup**: Alex secretly writes his original word: BATTLE. Bailey secretly writes her original word: MANAGE.  
**Turn 1 (Alex)**: Alex modifies his word: removes the letter "E" from BATTLE → BATTL. He records the change in a column: BATTLE, BATTL. Alex says: "Ready". The pot increases to 1 unit.  
**Turn 2 (Bailey)**: Bailey modifies her word: adds the letter "R" to MANAGE → MANAGER. She records the change: MANAGE, MANAGER. Bailey says: "Ready". The pot increases to 2 units.  
**Turn 3 (Alex)**: Alex modifies his word again: adds the letter "E" to the end of BATTL → BATTLE. He records the change: BATTLE, BATTL, BATTLE. Alex says: "Ready". The pot increases to 3 units. Since at least 3 turns have been completed, either player may now call "Show!" on their turn.  
**Turn 4 (Bailey)**: Bailey decides to challenge Alex. She says: "Show!". Alex must silently reveal his current word: BATTLE. Bailey has 60 seconds to study the word and guess Alex's original 6-letter word. Bailey considers: "The current word is BATTLE. The previous change was adding 'E' to BATTL. But the original word must be exactly 6 letters long. Could it be that he returned to his original word?". Bailey guesses: "BATTLE". Correct! Bailey wins the entire pot of 3 units. The game ends.  

## Alternative Outcome (If Bailey Had Guessed Incorrectly)
If Bailey had guessed wrong (for example, "BATTLE") and time had not expired: Alex would win the pot of 3 units. Alex would not be required to reveal his original word or modification history.  

## Alternative Outcome (If Time Had Expired)
If Bailey had not provided an answer within 60 seconds: Alex would win the pot of 3 units. Alex would not be required to reveal his original word or modification history.  

## This example demonstrates
The step-by-step modification process. How the pot increases with each "Ready" call. The strategy of returning to an original word to confuse the opponent. The challenge mechanics and possible outcomes. The importance of tracking word changes through the column method.
